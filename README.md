# THIS PACKAGE IS A WIP

I'm working on this package during this days (december 2022), i think i can show something during this month.
I'm trying to create a little set that provide some control on the forms, on the way the angular-forms do.

I'm building this only with astro and rxjs.

During this time feel free to try to broke the code, and contact me if you any advice (Link on my github profile).

## Run demo

Clone project:

> git clone https://github.com/DevPres/astro-form-elements.git
> cd astro-form-elements

> npm run start demo

The demo is a new Astro project, with dependency on astro-form-elements and rxjs
